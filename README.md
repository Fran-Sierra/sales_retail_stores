# sales_retail_stores

I answered 5 high level business questions.
   * What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
   * What city sold the most product?
   * What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
   * What products are most often sold together?
   * To answer these questions the raw data was  transformed using functions as Index, Textsplit, Month, Hour. Pivot tables (along 'sumifs' and 'wildcards' for the most sold together items) extracted useful information that later on was summarized an visualized on a dashboard.
